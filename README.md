This is a simple regression project. I have used following python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

I have used the following Models:
  1. KNeighborsRegressor
  2. LinearRegression
  3. XGBRegressor
  4. DescisonTreeRegressor
  5. RandomForestRegressor


Furthermore, I have performed Hyperparameter tuning for these models as well to optimize the performance of these models on validation and testing set and reduce loss function.

## Dataset
I have not included the dataset in the repository. However, you could find the official dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)

In this regression project, We will make use of different features like age, BMI, region, sex,  smoker, etc to predict the medical insurance cost for an individual.
